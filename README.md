Count Intersections README


Overview


This Python code defines a function count_intersections that calculates the count of intersections between pairs of chords formed by starting and ending angles. The chords are defined by input angles in radians and corresponding identifiers indicating whether each angle is a starting ('s') or an ending ('e') point.

Functionality
1. Input
radians: A list of angles in radians.
identifiers: A list of identifiers indicating whether each angle is a starting ('s') or an ending ('e') point.
2. Procedure
The code pairs up the starting and ending angles using identifiers and creates a list of tuples called chords.
The list of chords is sorted based on the starting angles.
The code then iterates through each pair of chords and checks for intersections using nested loops and specific conditions.
3. Output
The function returns the count of intersections between pairs of chords.
Example Usage
python
Copy code
# Example Input 1
radians1 = [0.78, 1.47, 1.77, 3.92]
identifiers1 = ['s_1', 'e_1', 's_2', 'e_2']

# Example Input 2
radians2 = [0.9, 1.3, 1.7, 2.92]
identifiers2 = ['s_1', 'e_2', 's_2', 'e_1']

# Test the function
print(count_intersections(radians1, identifiers1))  # Expected output: 1
print(count_intersections(radians2, identifiers2))  # Expected output: 0
Runtime Complexity
The code has a time complexity of O(n^2), where 'n' is the number of chords. The complexity is dominated by the nested loops used for comparing each pair of chords.

How to Run
Copy the count_intersections function into your Python environment.
Provide the required inputs (radians and identifiers) when calling the function.
The function will return the count of intersections between pairs of chords.
